Here, we present genomic, phylogenetic, and morphological characteristics of a symbiotic system associated with Melophagus ovinus, a member of the blood-feeding family Hippoboscidae. The system comprises four unrelated bacteria representing different stages in symbiosis evolution, from typical obligate mutualists inhabiting bacteriomes to freely associated commensals and parasites. Interestingly, the whole system provides a remarkable analogy to the association between Glossina and its symbiotic bacteria. In both, the symbiotic systems are composed of an obligate symbiont and two facultative intracellular associates, Sodalis and Wolbachia. In addition, extracellular Bartonella resides in the gut of Melophagus. However, the phylogenetic origins of the two obligate mutualist symbionts differ. In Glossina, the mutualistic Wigglesworthia appears to be a relatively isolated symbiotic lineage, whereas in Melophagus, the obligate symbiont originated within the widely distributed Arsenophonus cluster. Although phylogenetically distant, the two obligate symbionts display several remarkably similar traits (e.g., transmission via the host's “milk glands” or similar pattern of genome reduction). To obtain better insight into the biology and possible role of the M. ovinus obligate symbiont, “Candidatus Arsenophonus melophagi,” we performed several comparisons of its gene content based on assignments of the Cluster of Orthologous Genes (COG). Using this criterion, we show that within a set of 44 primary and secondary symbionts, “Ca. Arsenophonus” is most similar to Wigglesworthia. On the other hand, these two bacteria also display interesting differences, such as absence of flagellar genes in Arsenophonus and their presence in Wigglesworthia.

They are also considered the world's smallest bioreactors. The evolution of termites was marked by modifications on symbiont composition and acquisition of new feeding strategies that improved the digestion of lignocellulose resulting in the diversification of food sources. Nevertheless, some aspects of lignocellulose digestion in neotropical species are poorly known and studies are necessary to further comprehend their impact on the environment and their potential in the new bioeconomy. The aim of this proposal will be to study the digestion of lignocellulose and the community structure of the symbiotic microbiota in six species of neotropical higher termites by integrating ecological and molecular analyses. We will first compare microbiota functions of Cornitermes cumulans based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analyses. Then we will evaluate the activity of lignocellulases and the microbial community composition by six species of higher termites with different feeding strategies using enzymatic assays and 16S and ITS sequencing. We suggest that C. cumulans stores food in order to facilitate the digestion of lignocellulose by soil microorganisms before ingestion. In addition, both lignocellulose digestion and microbiota functional composition will be different according to termite feeding specialization.
